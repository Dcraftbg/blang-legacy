// So we have our stack. And we append values to said stack. And to access it you have 2 modes:
// -> Pop mode (it just pops off the elements from the top of the stack until it gets to your variable) (widely used for variables that are within the first 2 vars at the top of the stack)
// -> Pointer mode (it changes the place of our cursor and then gets the value at the location)
Scratched that idea :D


strformt     (size u3)
strOutBuffer (size u200) // a buffer you append chars to until its ready to ship
